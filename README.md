# Minecraft-Latest-Version-Grabber
Just some PHP to download the latest server version of minecraft, one shows the sha1 that is also provided by mojang.

## Function
* version.php will output the sha1, useful for other scripts to version check.
* latest.php will output the link to download the latest server jar.

Unfortunately PHP cannot be hosted as a Git Repo Page.
To run these scripts to get the desired outcome, execute using `php (script).php`
