# Minecraft-Latest-Version-Grabber
Just some PHP to download the latest server version of minecraft, one shows the sha1 that is also provided by mojang.

## Function
* [version.php](https://jakesta13.github.io/Minecraft-Latest-Version-Grabber/version.php) will output the sha1, useful for other scripts to version check.
* [latest.php](https://jakesta13.github.io/Minecraft-Latest-Version-Grabber/latest.php) will output the link to download the latest server jar.

Unfortunately PHP cannot be hosted as a Git Repo Page.


To run these scripts to get the desired outcome, execute using `php (script).php`
